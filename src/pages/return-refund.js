          <p>
            Our refund policy is 15 Days. Unfortunately we canâ€™t offer you a
            refund or exchange after this period. To be eligible for a return,
            your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received
            it. It must also be in the original packaging. Several types of
            goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food,
            flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not
            accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous
            materials, or flammable liquids or gases.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.
            Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.
